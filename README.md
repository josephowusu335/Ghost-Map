# Ghost-Map
Recreating John Snow's Ghost Map

### Project Description ###

In 1854, Dr. John Snow (no, not the Game of Thrones's character) used a 
pre-computer method of spatial analysis by mapping patterns and 
occurrences of cholera outbreaks in Soho, London. He mapped the deaths 
in the neighbourhood and determined that a vast majority occurred around 
one particular water well and that those that died used that well.

This is not only one of the earliest uses of data visualization, but by 
solving this problem, Dr. John Snow also founded spatial analysis and 
modern epidemiology. In this Python project, I reanalyze the data 
and recreate his famous map.
